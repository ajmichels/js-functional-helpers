# JS Functional Helpers

This is meant to be a very simple and lightweight project, inspired by
libraries like Ramda. By no means is this project anywhere near as robust as
Ramda, but it works for my purposes and is much much smaller.

For this project I am focusing mostly on functions for composition. When there
is a built-in function that meets my needs I choose that over something from a
library for most projects.
